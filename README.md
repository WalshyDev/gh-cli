# gh-cli
CLI app for me to do git and GitHub actions. Just to make my life easier and not need 40+ aliases

## What is this?
`gh-cli` is a small CLI script which I made to remove a bunch of aliases I have. Currently it's still pretty basic but it will do all of the main functions I need.

## How to install?
The only prerequisite is python3 so install that if you don't have it, download `gh.py`, modify the shebang if required (pointing to py3) and then just move to an executable dir like `/usr/bin/` as just `gh` (So, `/usr/bin/gh`).

## Contributing
If you wish to add additional features, clean up the code, improve performance or anything else then I am more than welcoming of PRs. I will try and review them as quick as possible but I have a lot of things to review on a daily basis have some patience.
