# gh-cli
CLI app for me to do git and GitHub actions. Just to make my life easier and not need 40+ aliases

## What is this?
`gh-cli` is a small CLI script which I made to remove a bunch of aliases I have. Currently it's still pretty basic but it will do all of the main functions I need.

## How to install?
To install `gh-cli`, just have wget and python3 installed and then run this command:
`wget -O - https://github.com/WalshyDev/gh-cli/raw/main/setup.sh | bash`

or alternatively, download `setup.sh` and run it.

## Contributing
If you wish to add additional features, clean up the code, improve performance or anything else then I am more than welcoming of PRs. I will try and review them as quick as possible but I have a lot of things to review on a daily basis have some patience.
